# search-plants
A web app built with JavaScript where users can filter options to find a suitable houseplant

## Project description

Users can filter from the following options:
* Amount of sunlight
* Amount of humidity
* Amount of feeding required
* Amount of watering required

The results will display the houseplants that are the most suitable for them.

Media queries and a grid layout make this page responsive.

Semantic html has been used throughout.

I would like to develop this project in the following ways:
* Add images of the different plant varieties
* Add text at the top to show the user how many items are in the results so they dont have to scroll down to see this information.
* Add a search bar so users can search for the plant name.
